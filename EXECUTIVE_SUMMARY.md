# Executive Summary: AEO/GEO Architect Workshop

**Prepared for:** Accenture Leadership & SAP Commerce Practice
**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** Production-Ready Training Asset

---

## Strategic Rationale

### The Market Shift

The commerce landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Traditional search engines (Google, Bing) are being augmented—and in some cases replaced—by AI-powered answer engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude). By 2025, an estimated **40% of product discovery** will occur through conversational AI rather than traditional search.

**Client Impact:**
- **58% of consumers** now use AI chatbots for product research before purchase
- **Google's SGE** (Search Generative Experience) fundamentally changes how products appear in search
- **Zero-click searches** are increasing—answers appear without visiting websites
- Traditional SEO strategies are becoming insufficient

### The Consultant Gap

Our SAP Commerce Cloud consultants are **world-class at traditional e-commerce architecture** but face a critical skills gap:

**What They Know:**
- SAP Commerce data modeling (ProductModel, PriceRow, Classifications)
- Catalog management and product information architecture
- Search indexing with Solr/Elasticsearch
- Traditional SEO and structured data basics

**What They Need:**
- **AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)** - How to structure data for AI consumption
- **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** - How to ensure LLMs cite your products
- **Vector embeddings** - The foundation of modern AI search
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** - How ChatGPT finds relevant products
- **Bot detection** - Understanding and optimizing for AI agent traffic

**Business Risk:** Without these skills, we cannot advise clients on AI-driven commerce transformation.

## Solution: Purpose-Built Training Workshop

### Design Principles

#### 1. **SAP Commerce Context** - Leverage Existing Expertise
We deliberately use SAP Commerce patterns (ProductModel, ManufacturerModel, PriceRowModel) because:

- **Zero cognitive load** - Consultants recognize familiar data structures immediately
- **Direct translation** - Skills transfer directly to client SAP Commerce implementations
- **Realistic scenarios** - 27 sample products mirror real client catalogs (Electronics, Apparel)
- **Enterprise patterns** - Multi-provider architecture reflects enterprise decision-making

**Strategic Advantage:** Consultants learn cutting-edge AI concepts *within* their domain expertise rather than abstract tutorials.

#### 2. **Flexible Learning Modalities** - Maximize Adoption

The workshop supports three deployment modes:

**Self-Guided Study (Individual):**
- Consultants complete at their own pace (6 hours total)
- Progressive hint system prevents frustration
- Complete solutions available for validation
- Ideal for continuous learning, pre-sales preparation

**Group Study (Team):**
- Teams work through exercises collaboratively
- Peer learning and knowledge sharing
- Can be incorporated into practice area meetings
- Builds shared competency across the team

**Instructor-Led (Formal Training):**
- Facilitated 2-day workshop with expert instructor
- Live coding demonstrations
- Real-time Q&A and troubleshooting
- Can be delivered to clients as value-add service

**Business Value:** Single training asset serves multiple use cases—maximizes ROI.

#### 3. **Offline-First Architecture** - Zero Friction Adoption

**Problem:** Traditional AI training requires expensive API keys, cloud accounts, complex setup.

**Our Solution:**
- **Precomputed embeddings** allow immediate start (no API keys needed)
- **Docker Compose** provides instant local environment
- **5-minute setup** from clone to running application
- **Works offline** - consultants can learn on planes, client sites

**Then scales to enterprise:**
- **Azure OpenAI** - For enterprise clients with Azure infrastructure
- **OpenAI Direct** - For flexible API access
- **Vertex AI** - For GCP-native architectures
- **Ollama** - For fully air-gapped/regulated environments

**Strategic Advantage:** Low barrier to entry drives adoption; enterprise options enable client delivery.
