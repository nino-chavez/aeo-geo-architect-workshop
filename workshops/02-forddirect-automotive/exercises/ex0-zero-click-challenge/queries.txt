# TESTING PROTOCOL

For each query:
1. Copy the exact query text
2. Paste into AI tool
3. DO NOT add context or rephrase
4. Record the FIRST response (before any follow-up questions)
5. Note:
   - Did it mention specific dealer names?
   - Did it claim to know inventory?
   - Did it admit limitations ("I can't access real-time data")?
   - Did it give generic advice?
   - Did anything seem inaccurate or made-up?

# EXPECTED CHALLENGES

- AI will often say "I don't have access to real-time inventory"
- AI may give dealer names but no specific stock information
- AI might hallucinate (make up dealer names or addresses)
- Different AI tools will give different answers to the same question
- Some AI tools will refuse to answer shopping queries

# WHAT TO LOOK FOR

✅ GOOD SIGNS:
- AI mentions specific dealer names
- AI provides accurate addresses/phone numbers
- AI acknowledges its limitations
- AI suggests ways to verify information

⚠️ WARNING SIGNS:
- AI claims to know current inventory (probably hallucinating)
- AI gives outdated dealer names
- AI is overly confident about details
- AI provides no sources or citations

❌ FAILURES:
- AI refuses to answer
- AI gives generic advice only ("Visit Ford.com")
- AI completely makes up dealer information
- AI contradicts itself
